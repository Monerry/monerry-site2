			<h1>Monerry Privacy Policy</h1>
			<div class="privacy">
				<p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") supplements the Terms of Service ("Terms") and describes how Monerry
					Limited ("Monerry", "Company", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information provided
					to us through our website monerry.com (the "Site"), and the services available through our Site
					("Monerry", "Service", or "Services").
				</p>

				<p>
					We collect information about users of our Service (our "Customers"), as well as our Customers' end
					users ("End Users") (collectively, "you", "your", or "yourself"). Note that Customers are also End
					Users, as we use our own Service to track itself. Some of the information collected may be Personal
					Data (defined as personal data of End Users that is processed by Monerry on behalf of Customers).
					Your rights regarding Personal Data are described in this Policy.
				</p>

				<p>
					By using the Service, you agree that your information will be handled as described by this Policy,
					and that your usage and any disputes over privacy are subject to the Agreement.
				</p>

				<p>
					Information we collect
					We collect information about you through your use of our Service and/or from the websites and
					services provided by our Customers.
				</p>

				<p>
					From Customers
					When you create an account, you provide us with a username, password, real name, and email address,
					as well as one or more websites that you own and want to monitor with the Service. If you make a
					purchase, you provide us with your billing information such as card number and address. This
					information is used for the purposes of having and maintaining your account. Your email is only used
					for important account notifications, such as a failed payment or expiring subscription, and
					occasional news and updates about the service.
				</p>

				<p>
					From End Users
					We collect information from End Users under the instruction of our Customers, under which
					circumstance we have no direct relationship with the End Users.
					The following information is logged to our tracking servers when an End User visits a Customer's
					website.
					URL &amp; Title of pages viewed
					URL &amp; Title of any links that are clicked on pages viewed
					Referrer
					User agent
					Screen resolution
					Language
					x/y coordinates of mouse events
					Anonymized IP address
					For visitors using VPNs such as Apple's iCloud Private Relay Opens in new browser tab, we will
					always log the full IP address of the VPN, as the visitor's true IP address is already hidden and
					does not require further anonymization.
				</p>

				<p>
					Additional information that may be logged if visitor privacy is disabled for fraud or security
					purposes:
					Full IP address ("IP")
					Unique ID tracking cookie ("UID") -- Most privacy laws consider a UID cookie to be Personal Data,
					even though it is randomly generated and does not identify who you are or reveal anything else about
					you. Its sole purpose is to more accurately track unique visitors.
					Custom data -- This feature can be used by a site to attach additional data to a visitor,
					potentially including Personal Data such as a name or email address, but it is against our Terms to
					log Personal Data using this feature without disclosure or (depending on "legitimate interest")
					consent. Customers are responsible for obtaining content from End Users, if necessary. This feature
					requires a small amount of configuration and coding by Customers, so only a small percentage of
					Customers use it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Processing of UID and IP Personal Data is lawful and does not require your direct consent because it
					is "necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests" (GDPR Article 6), and "necessary to
					fulfill the legitimate interests" (LGPD Article 7), of websites using the service. These legitimate
					interests include but are not limited to:
					Assembling statistics regarding the use of a website. (Accurately counting unique visitors is a
					vital statistic for any website).
					Preventing fraud and abuse, and maintaining information security. (Full IP addresses are necessary
					for this type of usage). (Recital 47 of the GDPR Opens in new browser tab states: "The processing of
					Personal Data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate
					interest".)
				</p>

				<p>
					As Customers of the Service are also End Users, the information listed above are also collected
					about our Customers when they are using the Service. The Personal Data that we log is as follows:
					Your UID and IP address, per the legitimate interests above.
					Your account username, per the legitimate interests above, as well as to help with customer service
					needs.
				</p>

				<p>
					How we use your information

					Customers
					To provide and maintain our Service to you.
					To help understand how Customers use our Service on an individual and aggregate basis in order to
					improve it.
					To help with customer service needs, such as troubleshooting issues that you report to us.
					To contact you with important account notifications, such as a failed payment or expiring
					subscription.
					To contact you with occasional product news and updates.
					Other research and analytical purposes such as Service performance, Customer behavior and retention,
					and common navigations through the Site.
				</p>

				<p>
					End Users
					To provide reports for our Customers on website traffic.
					To provide anonymized and aggregated reports such as our global web browser and OS marketshare.
				</p>

				<p>
					How we share your information

					Customer information
					We may share your information with service providers or contractors who perform actions or functions
					on our behalf, but only as necessary to provide and maintain the Service to you. All contractors and
					links to their privacy policies are listed below.
					We must share your billing information with our merchant account providers to charge you for the
					Service: Paypal, Authorize.net

					No Customer information is shared with any other third party for any purpose, except for the
					potential legal reasons listed below.
				</p>

				<p>
					End User information
					End User information collected from a Customer's website is only shared with that Customer.
				</p>

				<p>
					Customers can view End User geographic locations in an embedded Google Maps, but otherwise, no End
					User information is shared with any other third party for any purpose -- except for potential legal
					reasons listed below.
				</p>

				<p>
					Legal reasons that Customer or End User information may be shared:
					Meeting applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests.
					In response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
					enforcement requirements.
					Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, security, or technical issues.
					Protecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of Monerry, our Customers, or the public
					as required or permitted by law.
					Enforcing applicable Terms of Service.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cookies
					The following cookies are set by the Service. All cookies are first party unless otherwise noted.
					Temporary/session cookies may not all be listed.
				</p>

				<p>
					Customers:
					login
					If you check "remember me" on the login page, this cookie is set for 1 year to automatically log you
					in on future visits. Deleted if you manually "log out" of the Site.
					login_2fa
					Secondary "remember me" cookie when two-factor authentication login is enabled for your account.
					Expires after 30 days. Deleted if you manually "log out" of the Site.
					osa
					Third party cookie, for authenticating the on-site analytics widget when visiting your own websites.
					Saved for 30 days. Deleted if you manually "log out" of the Site.
					ignore
					Third party cookie, for ignoring your own visits to your own websites. Saved for 1 year.
				</p>

				<p>
					End Users:
					No tracking cookies are used with the default visitor privacy settings.
					If privacy is disabled, the following cookies may be used to enhance tracking:
					_first_pageview
					There are a few pieces of data that we only need the tracking code to send on the first pageview of
					a visitor session. This cookie helps us achieve that. Expires after 10 minutes.
					_heatmaps_g2g_[site_id]
					Heatmaps data is sampled at 50% by default, because it consumes a lot of excess bandwidth and
					storage. With cookies, we are able to make the randomness be per visitor instead of per page view.
					This cookie helps us achieve that. Expires after 10 minutes.
					_referrer_og
					Stores external referrer for 30 days for better long term attribution of traffic sources.
					_utm_og
					Stores dynamic (UTM) campaign variables for 30 days for better long term attribution of marketing
					efforts.
					_custom_data_[key]
					Only set if a site is using custom data tracking. These cookies cache certain custom data keys for
					30 days so that they're attached to sessions even when a visitor is not logged in.
					_no_tracky_[site_id]
					This cookie reduces bandwidth usage when certain visitor filters are active, and expires after 1
					hour. NOTE: The Terms of Service require you to remove the tracking code from all websites upon
					termination of your account. For sites that break the Terms and leave the code installed, this
					cookie will always be set, regardless of privacy settings, in order to minimize bandwidth and CPU
					resource usage on our tracking servers.
					_jsuid
					A random integer generated upon someone's first visit to a website, for identifying unique visitors
					as accurately as possible. Stored for 1 year.
					aff
					If an End User clicks a Customer's affiliate link, we save the Customer's referral ID in this cookie
					for 30 days.
				</p>

				<p>
					Security
					To the best of our ability, we protect all of our data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access
					and destruction.
				</p>

				<p>
					Secure (HTTPS) access is forced for our Site to help keep your information, including login
					credentials, secure in transit. Two-factor authentication login is available for Customers that need
					extra account security.
				</p>

				<p>
					You are responsible for using a strong and unique password for the Site to help keep your account
					secure. We are not responsbile for any unauthorized activity on your account because of lost, weak,
					or compromised passwords, or disabled two-factor authentication.
				</p>

				<p>
					EU &amp; Swiss Privacy Shield
					Monerry Limited complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
					Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
					retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries and the United Kingdom and
					Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Monerry has certified that
					it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict
					between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield
					Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield
					program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
				</p>

				<p>
					Monerry Limited acknowledges that EU and Swiss individuals have the right to access, correct, amend,
					and delete their Personal Data. EU and Swiss Customers may contact us via email. End Users, with
					whom we we have no direct relationship, should send their inquiries directly to our Customer. If
					requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties
					other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally
					collected or subsequently authorized.
				</p>

				<p>
					To limit the use and disclosure of your Personal Data, please contact us via email.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the context of an onward transfer, Monerry has responsibility for the processing of Personal Data
					it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent
					on its behalf. Monerry shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such Personal
					Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Monerry proves that it is not responsible
					for the event giving rise to the damage.
				</p>

				<p>
					In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Monerry commits to resolve complaints about your
					privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Data transferred to the United States pursuant to
					Privacy Shield. European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints
					should first contact us via email.
				</p>

				<p>
					Monerry has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield
					Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by
					BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your
					complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
					https://bbbprograms.org/privacy-shield-complaints for more information and to file a complaint. This
					service is provided free of charge to you.
				</p>

				<p>
					If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain
					conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other
					redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at
					https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction
				</p>

				<p>
					In July 2020, EU and Swiss courts declared their respective US Privacy Shield Frameworks to be
					inadequate for the transfer of Personal Data to the United States. Companies within these regions
					must now use the updated 2021 EU Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") instead. The UK (after
					Brexit) has recognized the new EU SCCs as well, with a small addendum. Our Data Processing Agreement
					has been updated to include these SCCs for Customers in these regions.
				</p>

				<p>
					Personal Data rights
					EU, UK and Swiss residents have the legal right to access, correct, and delete their Personal Data,
					per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with some exceptions. Residents of California and
					Brazil have similar rights and exceptions, per the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Lei
					Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD), respectively.
				</p>

				<p>
					Customers may contact us directly to access or delete their data. End Users, with whom we we have no
					direct relationship, should send their inquiries directly to the Customer in question, as we are
					considered simply a "Data Processor" per the GDPR and a "Service Provider" per the CCPA. End Users
					may opt out of tracking entirely if desired, also known as "Do not sell my personal information" in
					California.
				</p>

				<p>
					If we receive a request from an End User in relation to Personal Data processed for a Customer, we
					will advise the End User to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for
					responding to such request using the tools we have provided on our Site for handling Personal Data
					requests. Customer agrees to use all reasonable measures to verify the identity and location of an
					End User before sharing or modifying Personal Data.
				</p>

				<p>
					Customers can export their data using the API or the export function, or delete their account using
					the link at the top of the user preferences page.
				</p>

				<p>
					We retain Personal Data on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide our Service to
					them, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
					agreements. To protect against accidental or malicious deletion, there is a delay before data is
					removed from our active systems and data will remain in our backup systems for up to 1 year before
					it is fully deleted.
				</p>

				<p>
					The CCPA requires us to disclose the information we have collected and "sold" over the last 12
					months. This is covered in Information we collect.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Service is not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided
					us with Personal Data, the data will be deleted.
				</p>

				<p>
					Contact us
					If you need to contact us about privacy, Personal Data, or Data Protection, or would like to make a
					complaint, please contact us by email.
